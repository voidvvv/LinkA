# LinkA
linKA is an opensource game, which you should do is to find and link two cards in same patterns.

# build
it's source code of game, and I use openGL, OpenAL and other related utils in this game, so maybe you'd better to install them first.
or I'd like to push aa release version (when the game is good enough I think)

# other
some of codes refer the [LIBGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx), which I think is a fantastic game framework.
I prefer to call it framework rather than game engine, because it has no UI design at all! 
It's cool for me to use this completely code to create game.
